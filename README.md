## 🧠 About Me

I'm currently transitioning from software development (C++, DevOps, Vue.js) into offensive security and cloud infrastructure auditing.

I'm preparing for the **OSCP** and **AWS Security Specialty** while building a strong practical skillset through CTFs, real-world labs, and hands-on automation.

I focus on delivering clean, actionable security insights to dev teams, startups, and SaaS builders — no fluff, just results.
